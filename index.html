                    <li>Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, using her discretionary powers, allotted secret funds when these
                        aerospace projects were disapproved by the Union Cabinet.
                    </li>
                    <li>Dr. Kalam and Dr. V.S. Arunachalam, on the proposal of the then Defense Minister R.
                        Venkataraman, worked on developing a quiver of missiles instead of one at a time. Dr. Kalam was
                        made the Chief Executive of the programme, which was named Integrated Guided Missile Development
                        programme.

                        political role. At the time of the testing phase, he, along with R. Chidambaram, was made the
                        Chief Project Coordinator.
